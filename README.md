Module_15_MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis _using _R
##Overview##</br>
AutosRUs' new MechaCar is "suffering from production troubles" and the company is hoping that an analytical review may help provide some insight.</br>
The goal of this project is to:</br>

discover which variables predict the MPG for vehicle prototypes;</br>
collect summary stats on the PSI of suspension coils;</br>
determine if manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population;</br>
design a study to compare the MechaCar performance against vehicles from other manufacturers.</br>
